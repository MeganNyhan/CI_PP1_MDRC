 <h1>PROJECT 1: THE MILFORD AND DISTRICT RESOURCE CENTRE WEBSITE </h1>

The MDRC website is a website for the company Milford and District Resource Centre (MDRC). The company itself is a central hub of community services that are offerd the local community of Milford. The site owner's (MDRC) goal of the site is for the site to be a public source of information regarding the services the resource centre has to offer. The external's user's goal is to learn more about the services offered to them by the resource centre and to be able to ask for more information about the services through the website. I chose this company to work with as I am their in-house graphic designer and recognised their need for a website.

<h2><strong>Design:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Design Choices</strong></h3>

<p> The company itself is a company with a wide target audience, and with this in mind I wanted to create a site that was accessible to everyone regardless of their technical ability, and ability to operate a computer. I wanted all designs to be simplistic, the navigation to be logical and seamless and for the accessibility to be a primary concern. </p>

<h3><strong>Colour</strong></h3>

  <p>The color scheme that I have used throughout the website is taken directly from the brand guidelines that were available to be as a member of the organisation. To verfiy the contrast in colours were accessible I tested them on WebAIM which they all passed as readable. </p>

<details><summary>Colours and Brand Guidelines</summary>
  <img src="assets/images/mdrc-brand-guidelines.png"></details>

  <h3><strong>Fonts</strong></h3>
  <p>Fonts used on the website were Open Sans Bold and Open Sans Light. Open sans bold was used for headings and open sans light was used in paragraphs.</p>

  <h3><strong>Structure</strong></h3>
<p>The strucutre of this website was designed to be easily navagated through and easy to learn. I made sure that each page followed a similar structure but didn't comprimise the content that each page held. The following pages are within the structure of the site:</p>

<ul>
<li> A home Page = Basic information about the site, with an image of the building and a meet the team section.</li>
<li> A Services page = The services page offers an overview of the services offered by the resource center. </li>
<li> A gallery page = Offers the user a chance to see possible familiar faces taking part in local activites/ meetings.    This page aims to encourage the user to want to partake in the activites/ events themselves.</li>
<li> A Contact Page = Gives the user contact information and a google maps view of where the building is. There is also a contact form for a user to use to contact the comapny.</li>

<h3><strong>Wireframes</strong></h3>

<p>The wireframes included have evolved and changed since I originally drew them up over a week ago. This is due to the limitations of my skills thus far developed and changes I have made personally to the look of the site when building it.</p>
