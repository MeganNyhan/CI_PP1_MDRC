    <h1> <strong>About Us </strong> </h1>
        <div class="about">
            <p>
                Milford & District Resource Centre is a facility based on Market Square at the top of the town in Milford, Co. Donegal. We are here to support and
                facilitate the community in making the wider Milford area a better place to live, work and play in.

                Originally founded as IRD Milford in the 1990s, MDRC is a community resource which is governed by a Board of Directors. We aim to support
                all existing community groups and sports clubs in the Milford area, as well as to help and guide the setting up of any new projects 
                or initiatives in the district.

                MDRC is funded by a central grant from the Department of Rural and Community Development, administered by Pobal. This grant covers
                90% of salary costs for 5 of our 6 employees. One of our central aims is to provide employment in the local community.

                We operate a social enterprise ‘Community Business Solutions’ which generates an income to cover overheads associated with the running of 
                the resource centre. Any surplus profits are then transferred into the  Milford Development Fund, which is expressly for community development
                initiatives and supporting existing community groups and sports clubs in the wider Milford area.

                We are also the base for social prescribing in the wider Milford-Fanad-Rosguill area. This position is fully funded by the HSE.
