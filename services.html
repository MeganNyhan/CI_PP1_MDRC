                    <h1>Services we offer at the Milford and District Resource centre</h1>

                    <p> We provide a number of services for the community at the resource centre, including room rental for meetings and events, printing and photocopying, graphic design, grant application support and the provision of training. We also operate the Rags to Riches charity shop on Main Street, Milford. Money raised from this also goes into the Milford Development Fund for redistribution to the local community.
                        <br>
                        We are also the base for social prescribing in the wider Milford-Fanad-Rosguill area. This position is fully funded by the HSE.
